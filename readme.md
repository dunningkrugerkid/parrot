this is **parrot**

parrot is a *discord bot* 

parrot is a RNN that runs off a dataset that is not included here for privacy reasons

you can run parrot yourself if you want to. you will need to change the code that parses the dataset, as it parses a mongoDB database that was converted to .csv format

the usual "make a .env file" spiel applies

parrot needs a lot of RAM! I found success with minimum 6GB

i am running it on a DigitalOcean droplet
